# Streaming Guide for Guests 
All interviews are streamed live on the [GitHub Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/GitHub) (using Streamyard) and get edited to live on Youtube as shareable content.

## Recording Software and equipment: 
We will use streamyard to stream on Twitch.

**Multiple remote guests will need to have separate mics and headphones to cut down on room noise.** 

## Format and example questions: 

The stream will be a laid back format:

1. Introduce yourself  - 5 minutes
2. What is your project?
3. Demo - 5-10 minutes (What does it do? Do you have an example/hello-world?)
5. What was your motivation for building your project or how did this project started? 
6. How can people contribute?
7. What was the last thing you pushed to using GitHub? Or What is the next thing you would like to push?
8. Are there any questions from the audience?
### Wrap up questions
- What is your best tip for new contributors?
- What's your favorite song of all time?
- What emoji best describes you?
- What is your favorite ice cream flavor?

### Goodbye â€“ whole stream shouldnâ€™t last more than 30-45 minutes

## General Interview Guidelines:

Feel free to get specific about your experiences and provide examples on what you're talking about. Also remember the target audience is people interested in programming, but not all experts, so try to define any tech terms, and use less jargon when possible. ðŸ’¡

## Lighting: 

There is no requirement here, but please consider lighting. [Here's a great article on the importance of lighting and how to setup lighting for you stream/webinar/video](https://livestream.com/blog/lighting-live-video-webinar).

**Hardwired Ethernet is always preferred over wifi**
