Thank you for agreeing to speak about your project on Open Source Friday! I really appreciate you taking the time to be a part of the discussion, and Iâ€™m very excited to hear your story and showcase your project! Itâ€™s really going to help a lot of folks!

# Streaming Guide for Guests 
All interviews are streamed live on the [GitHub YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEFmtstItnKlhJJVmMghxc0P) (using Streamyard) and get edited to live on Youtube as shareable content.

## Recording Software and equipment: 
We will use streamyard to stream on Twitch.

**Multiple remote guests will need to have separate mics and headphones to cut down on room noise.** 

Check [General Questions](https://github.com/githubevents/open-source-friday-apac/blob/main/admin/guest-assets/General-Questions.md) for format and example questions.

The whole stream shouldnâ€™t last more than 30-45 minutes

## General Interview Guidelines:

Feel free to get specific about your experiences and provide examples on what you're talking about. Also remember the target audience is people interested in programming, but not all experts, so try to define any tech terms, and use less jargon when possible. ðŸ’¡

## Lighting: 

There is no requirement here, but please consider lighting. [Here's a great article on the importance of lighting and how to setup lighting for you stream/webinar/video](https://livestream.com/blog/lighting-live-video-webinar).

**Hardwired Ethernet is always preferred over wifi**
